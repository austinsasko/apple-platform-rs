Sign a simple application bundle

```
$ mkdir -p MyApp.app/Contents/MacOS
$ rcodesign debug-create-macho MyApp.app/Contents/MacOS/MyApp
writing Mach-O to MyApp.app/Contents/MacOS/MyApp

$ rcodesign sign MyApp.app MyApp.app.signed
? 1
signing MyApp.app to MyApp.app.signed

Error: error interfacing with directory-based bundle: Info.plist not found; not a valid bundle

$ rcodesign debug-create-info-plist --bundle-name MyApp MyApp.app/Contents/Info.plist
writing MyApp.app/Contents/Info.plist

$ rcodesign sign MyApp.app MyApp.app.signed
signing MyApp.app to MyApp.app.signed
signing bundle at MyApp.app
signing 0 nested bundles in the following order:
signing bundle at MyApp.app into MyApp.app.signed
collecting code resources files
Contents/Info.plist is the Info.plist file; handling specially
copying file MyApp.app/Contents/Info.plist -> MyApp.app.signed/Contents/Info.plist
writing sealed resources to MyApp.app.signed/Contents/_CodeSignature/CodeResources
signing main executable Contents/MacOS/MyApp
setting main executable binary identifier to com.example.mybundle (derived from CFBundleIdentifier in Info.plist)
inferring default signing settings from Mach-O binary
signing Mach-O binary at index 0
creating ad-hoc signature
code directory version: 132096
total signature size: 405 bytes
writing signed main executable to MyApp.app.signed/Contents/MacOS/MyApp
